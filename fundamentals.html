    <h1>Fundamentals</h1>

    <p>
      Superconductors are materials that exhibit the state of superconductivity,
      in which they offer zero electrical resistance and do not permit magnetic
      fields to penetrate. As a result, an electric current flowing through a
      superconductor can continue to flow indefinitely without any energy loss
      or degradation. Superconductivity was discovered on April 8, 1911 by Heike
      Kamerlingh Onnes. At the Mercury temperature of 4.2K, he observed that the
      resistance abruptly disappeared. In subsequent decades, superconductivity
      was observed in several other materials. In 1913, lead was found to be
      superconductor at 7 K, and in 1941 niobium nitride was found to
      superconduct at 16K. Before 1980, the critical temperature found cannot be
      higher than 30K. Those superconductors are called conventional
      superconductors. Theoretically, they can be fully explained by BCS theory
      and phenomenological LandauGinzburg theory. A perfect superconductor is a
      material that exhibits two characteristic properties, namely zero
      electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism, when it is cooled below a
      particular temperature Tc, called the critical temperature. At higher
      temperatures it is a normal metal, and ordinarily is not a very good
      conductor. For example, lead, tantalum, and tin become superconductors,
      while copper, silver, and gold, which are much better conductors, do not
      superconduct. In the normal state some superconducting metals are weakly
      diamagnetic and some are paramagnetic. Below Tc they exhibit perfect
      electrical conductivity and also perfect or quite pronounced diamagnetism.
      Perfect diamagnetism, the second characteristic property, means that a
      superconducting material does not permit an externally applied magnetic
      field to penetrate into its interior. Superconductivity has a wide range
      of applications in various fields of science and technology. Here are some
      of the applications of superconductivity:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Superconducting magnets are used in
        MRI machines to create strong magnetic fields. These magnets produce a
        more accurate and detailed image of internal body organs and tissues,
        making MRI an essential tool in medical diagnosis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Particle Accelerators: Superconducting magnets are used in particle
        accelerators to produce high-energy particle beams. This is important in
        high-energy physics research and can help us understand the fundamental
        properties of matter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Power Transmission: Superconducting wires can transmit electricity with
        zero resistance, which means less energy is lost during transmission.
        This makes superconducting power cables more efficient and
        cost-effective compared to traditional power cables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Levitating Trains: Superconductors can be used to levitate trains above
        the track, reducing friction and increasing efficiency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Energy Storage: Superconducting energy storage devices can store large
        amounts of energy for long periods without any significant loss. This
        technology is important for renewable energy systems, where energy
        storage is crucial to manage fluctuations in supply and demand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quantum Computing: Superconducting materials are used in quantum
        computers to create qubits, which are the basic building blocks of
        quantum computers. These computers have the potential to perform
        calculations much faster than traditional computers.

      The electrical conductivity of metals arises from the presence of free
      electrons in their outermost shells that can move freely in response to an
      electric field. When a current flows through a metal, these free electrons
      move in a direction along the applied electric field. Meanwhile, the ions,
      which are positively charged, remain fixed in position and they vibrate in
      place around their equilibrium positions, known as lattice vibrations. The
      resistance of a metal to electrical current flow is due to the scattering
      of these free electrons by lattice vibrations. As the temperature
      increases, the amplitude of these lattice vibrations also increases,
      causing more frequent collisions between the free electrons and lattice
      vibrations. Consequently, the resistance of the metal increases with
      temperature. The dependence of resistivity ρ on temperature for a typical
      metal is shown in Figure 1. At low temperatures, the resistivity of a
      metal decreases as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is
      because at low temperatures, the lattice vibrations are reduced, and the
      scattering of electrons is minimized. However, at T=0, the resistivity is
      not zero due to the presence of impurities in the metal. This residual
      resistivity is denoted by ρ0. The temperature dependence of resistivity
      can be expressed by the Matthiessen’s rule, which states that the total
      resistivity of a metal is the sum of its residual resistivity and its
      temperature-dependent part, as expressed in Equation 1. ρ = ρ0 + ρ(T) ---
      (1) Here, ρ is the resistivity of the given metal, ρ0 is the residual
      resistivity, and ρ(T) is the temperature-dependent part of the
      resistivity.
