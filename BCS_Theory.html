    <h1>BCS Theory</h1>
    <p>
      The BCS theory is based on the formation of Cooper pairs. In 1957,
      Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer proposed a microscopic theory known as BCS
      theory. The BCS theory explains most of the phenomena associated with
      superconductivity in a natural manner. This theory involves electron
      interaction through phonon as mediators. In 1950, Frohlich and Bardeen
      showed the existence of self-energy of electrons accompanied by virtual
      phonons when they move through a crystal lattice. During the flow of
      current in a superconductor, when an electron approaches a positive ion of
      the metal lattice, there is Coulomb attraction between the electron and
      the lattice ion. This produces a distortion in the lattice i.e., the
      positive ion gets displaced from its mean position. The distortion gives
      rise to a phonon. Smaller the mass of the positive ion core, the greater
      will be the distortion. This interaction called the electron-phonon
      interaction leads to the scattering of the electron and causes electrical
      resistivity. The distortion causes an increase in the density of ions in
      the region of distortion. The higher density of ions in the distorted
      regions attracts, in its turn another electron. Thus, a free electron
      exerts an attractive force another electron through phonons. Phonons are
      quanta of lattice vibrations. Suppose, an electron of wave vector K emits
      a virtual phonon q which is absorbed by another electron having wave
      vector K1. Thus, K is scattered as K-q and K1+q is as shown in figure 1.
      The resulting electron-electron interaction depends on the relative
      magnitude of the electronic energy change; the interaction becomes an
      attractive interaction (Vph). Thus, for attractive interaction, the wave
      vector and spin are represented as K↓ and K↑. Therefore, the two electrons
      interacting attractively in the phonon field are called cooper pair At
      normal temperature, the attractive force is too small and pairing of
      electrons does not take place. Since the number of phonons increases with
      temperature, the resistivity is a sensitive function of temperature,
      particularly in the low-temperature region when it varies at T5. At lower
      temperature i.e., below the critical temperature, the apparent force of
      attraction reaches a maximum value for any two electrons of equal and
      opposite spins and opposite momentum. This force of attraction exceeds the
      Columbian force of repulsion between two electrons and the electron stick
      together and move a pairs. These pairs of electrons of opposite momenta
      are called Cooper pairs. A pair of electrons formed by the interaction
      between the electrons with opposite spin and momenta in a phonon field is
      called a Cooper pair. The Cooper pair has a total spin of zero. As a
      result, the electron pairs in a superconductor are bosons. At a
      temperature T < Tc, the lattice electron interaction is stronger than the
      electron-electron force of Coulomb. In a typical superconductor, the
      volume of a given pair encompasses as many 106 other pairs. This dense
      cloud of Cooper pairs forms a collective state where strong correlations
      arise among the motions of all pairs because of which they drift
      cooperatively through the material. Thus, the superconducting state is an
      ordered state of the conduction electrons. The motion of all Cooper pairs
      is the same. Either they are at rest, or if the superconductor carries a
      current, they drift with identical velocity. Since the density of Cooper
      pairs is quite high, even large currents require only a small velocity.
      The small velocity of Cooper pairs combined with their precise ordering
      minimizes collision processes. The extremely rare collisions of Cooper
      pairs with the lattice lead to vanishing resistivity. At this stage,
